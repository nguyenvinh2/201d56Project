### Work Plan

    - The project repository will reside on Github.
    - Team members will meet in person from 9AM-6PM to develop the project for its duration.
    - The team will follow initial planning that was agreed upon. 
    - The team will have a daily standup first thing in the morning. The daily standup will 
      set the daily goals and tasks for the day depending on progress.
    - Each member during stand up will also have a chance to address any concerns and to gauge the 
      progress being made by each team member.
    - Each member will understand their task for the day prior to completion of stand-up.
    - Updates to the project will be completed via the Git Plan.
    - Before leaving, the group will get together and evaluate the progress for the day and identify
      signs of potential problems for correction during next morning's stand up.

### Conflict Plan

    When faced with conflict, members involved in the conflict should first try to amicable resolve
    the problem between them. Upon failure of a resolution, the entire group will discuss the issue
    beforehand in order to make a decision. If a solution cannot be reached unanimously, then a majority 
    vote is required to proceed forward. All team members will agree to the commit to the decision made
    by the group.

    Members who appear to have inadequately contribute to the group shall be assessed by themselves as
    well as the group the area where they can make the most contribution. If lack of contribution is
    due to willful poor effort rather than technical capabilities, then it should be reported.

### Communication Plan

    - Our team plans to use Slack and Chime as well as in person for all communication on project planning 
      and version control.
    - Our team plans to approach decision making in a transparent and open manner.
    - Morning stand-ups and end of day check-in in the normal work plan can also be used for discussing any issues.

### Git Process

    - After initial scaffolding of the master branch, restrictions will be placed on the master branch to prevent 
      single user merging.
    - Atleast two review approvals is require to merge to master.
    - Each person work on their own branch. The branch owner is encouraged to experiment this branch, including 
      pulling from other userâ€™s branch.
    - On intermittent periods during the working day, the group will to execute a merging process. Everyone 
      will give status reports on the progress of their work and propose merging the master branch via a Pull Request.
      The author of the branch should verify the target branch is functional prior a PR.
    - Once merged, all users will update their own local branch with the updated repository. 
    - The last person to give approval during the review process shall merge into master.
    - Ideally, the merging process would coincide at the beginning and end of the day status report. 
      This will allow an orderly merging process and allow users to work on their own branch. 
      If a completed feature is needed to be incorporated sometime in the middle of the workday,
      then the normal process shall be followed.
    - An ad-hoc review meeting can be initiated by any member for merging into master.
